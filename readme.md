# React & Python - AI Technologies

This is a work in progress repo where I highlight my Python/React skills but most importantly different machine learning technologies. Such as YOLO, GANs, Generative AI, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc.

## Requirements

* Docker
* Nvidia GPU (RTX Highly Recommended)

## Getting Started

```
$ docker-compose build backend
$ docker-compose build frontend
$ docker-compose up backend
$ docker-compose up frontend
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend.
